                    <h3>DEFINITION:</h3>
                    <p>In straightforward terms, an exoplanet is defined as any planet that doesn’t orbit our home
                        star, the Sun. The prefix <em>‘exo’</em> comes from Greek, meaning ‘outside’.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="exoplanet-text-2">
                    <h3>HISTORY:</h3>
                    <p>The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognised as such.
                        However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988. Shortly afterwards, the
                        first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets
                        orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a
                        main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around
                        the nearby star 51 Pegasi.</p>
                    <p>Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the
                        vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the
                        radial-velocity method. As of 1st November 2018, there are 3,874 confirmed planets in 2,892
                        systems, with 638 systems having more than one planet.</p>

                    <h3>THE PARSEC</h3>
                    <p>The parsec (symbol: pc) is a unit of length used to measure large distances to astronomical
                        objects outside the Solar System. A parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical
                        unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond, which corresponds to (648000 / π) astronomical units.</p>
                    <p>One parsec is equal to about 3.26 light-years (30 trillion km or 19 trillion miles) in length.
                        The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs (4.2 light-years) from the Sun. Most
                        of the stars visible to the unaided eye in the night sky are within 500 parsecs of the Sun.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="astro-unit-text">
                    <h3>ASTRONOMICAL UNIT</h3>
                    <p>The astronomical unit (symbol: AU) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from Earth to the
                        Sun. However, that distance varies as Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum (aphelion) to a
                        minimum (perihelion) and back again once a year.</p>
                    <p>Originally conceived as the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion, since 2012 it has been
                        defined as exactly 149,597,870,700 metres or about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles).</p>
                    <p>The astronomical unit is used primarily for measuring distances within the Solar System or
                        around other stars. However, it is also a fundamental component in the definition of another
                        unit of astronomical length, the parsec.</p>

                    <h3>ORBITAL MOTION</h3>
                    <p>In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the
                        trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, an orbit
                        refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating
                        trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the
                        central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of
                        planetary motion</p>
