                <section id="exoplanet-text-1">
                    <h3>DEFINITION:</h3>
                    <p>In straightforward terms, an exoplanet is defined as any planet that doesn’t orbit our home
                        star, the Sun. The prefix <em>‘exo’</em> comes from Greek, meaning ‘outside’.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="exoplanet-text-2">
                    <h3>HISTORY:</h3>
                    <p>The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognised as such.
                        However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988. Shortly afterwards, the
                        first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets
                        orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a
                        main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around
                        the nearby star 51 Pegasi.</p>
                    <p>Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the
                        vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the
                        radial-velocity method. As of 1st November 2018, there are 3,874 confirmed planets in 2,892
                        systems, with 638 systems having more than one planet.</p>

                <section id="parsec-text">
                    <h3>THE PARSEC</h3>
                    <p>The parsec (symbol: pc) is a unit of length used to measure large distances to astronomical
                        objects outside the Solar System. A parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical
                        unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond, which corresponds to (648000 / π) astronomical units.</p>
                    <p>One parsec is equal to about 3.26 light-years (30 trillion km or 19 trillion miles) in length.
                        The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs (4.2 light-years) from the Sun. Most
                        of the stars visible to the unaided eye in the night sky are within 500 parsecs of the Sun.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="astro-unit-text">
                    <h3>ASTRONOMICAL UNIT</h3>
                    <p>The astronomical unit (symbol: AU) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from Earth to the
                        Sun. However, that distance varies as Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum (aphelion) to a
                        minimum (perihelion) and back again once a year.</p>
                    <p>Originally conceived as the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion, since 2012 it has been
                        defined as exactly 149,597,870,700 metres or about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles).</p>
                    <p>The astronomical unit is used primarily for measuring distances within the Solar System or
                        around other stars. However, it is also a fundamental component in the definition of another
                        unit of astronomical length, the parsec.</p>

                    <h3>ORBITAL MOTION</h3>
                    <p>In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the
                        trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, an orbit
                        refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating
                        trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the
                        central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of
                        planetary motion</p>

                    <h3>RADIAL VELOCITY METHOD</h3>
                    <p>The radial velocity method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, is the most effective method
                        for locating extrasolar planets with existing technology. Though other approaches hold great
                        promise for the future, the vast majority of Exoplanets discovered so far were detected by this
                        method.</p>
                    <p>The radial velocity method relies on the fact that a star does not remain completely stationary
                        when it is orbited by a planet. It moves, ever so slightly, in a small circle or ellipse,
                        responding to the gravitational tug of its smaller companion. When viewed from a distance,
                        these slight movements affect the star's normal light spectrum, or colour signature. If the
                        star is moving towards the observer, then its spectrum would appear slightly shifted towards
                        the blue; if it is moving away, it will be shifted towards the red.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="microlensing-text">
                    <h3>GRAVITATIONAL MICROLENSING</h3>
                    <p>Gravitational microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens,
                        magnifying the light of a distant background star. This effect occurs only when the two stars
                        are almost exactly aligned. Lensing events are brief, lasting for weeks or days, as the two
                        stars and Earth are all moving relative to each other. More than a thousand such events have
                        been observed over the past ten years.</p>
                    <p>If the foreground lensing star has a planet, then that planet's own gravitational field can make
                        a detectable contribution to the lensing effect. Since that requires a highly improbable
                        alignment, a very large number of distant stars must be continuously monitored in order to
                        detect planetary microlensing contributions at a reasonable rate. This method is most fruitful
                        for planets between Earth and the centre of the galaxy, as the galactic centre provides a large
                        number of background stars.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="transit-method-text">
                    <h3>TRANSIT METHOD</h3>
                    <p>This method detects distant planets by measuring the minute dimming of a star as an orbiting
                        planet passes between it and the Earth. The passage of a planet between a star and the Earth is
                        called a "transit." If such a dimming is detected at regular intervals and lasts a fixed length
                        of time, then it is very probable that a planet is orbiting the star and passing in front of it
                        once every orbital period.</p>
                    <p>The dimming of a star during transit directly reflects the size ratio between the star and the
                        planet: A small planet transiting a large star will create only a slight dimming, while a large
                        planet transiting a small star will have a more noticeable effect. The size of the host star
                        can be known with considerable accuracy from its spectrum, and photometry therefore gives
                        astronomers a good estimate of the orbiting planet's size, but not its mass. This makes
                        photometry an excellent complement to the spectroscopic method, which provides an estimate of a
                        planet's mass, but not its size. Using both methods, combining mass and size, scientists can
                        calculate the planet's density, an important step towards assessing its composition.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="direct-imaging-text">
                    <h3>DIRECT IMAGING</h3>
                    <p>Planets are extremely faint light sources compared to stars, and what little light comes from
                        them tends to be lost in the glare from their parent star. So in general, it is very difficult
                        to detect and resolve them directly from their host star. Planets orbiting far enough from
                        stars to be resolved reflect very little starlight, so planets are detected through their
                        thermal emission instead.</p>
                    <p>It is easier to obtain images when the star system is relatively near to the Sun, and when the
                        planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent
                        star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. Images have then been made in the
                        infrared, where the planet is brighter than it is at visible wavelengths. Coronagraphs are used
                        to block light from the star, while leaving the planet visible.</p>

                <section id="pulsar-timing-text">
                    <h3>PULSAR TIMING METHOD</h3>
                    <p>A pulsar is a neutron star: the small, ultra-dense remnant of a star that has exploded as a
                        supernova. Pulsars emit radio waves extremely regularly as they rotate. Because the intrinsic
                        rotation of a pulsar is so regular, slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses
                        can be used to track the pulsar's motion. Like an ordinary star, a pulsar will move in its own
                        small orbit if it has a planet. Calculations based on pulse-timing observations can then reveal
                        the parameters of that orbit.</p>
                    <p>This method was not originally designed for the detection of planets, but is so sensitive that
                        it is capable of detecting planets far smaller than any other method can, down to less than a
                        tenth the mass of Earth. It is also capable of detecting mutual gravitational perturbations
                        between the various members of a planetary system, thereby revealing further information about
                        those planets and their orbital parameters. In addition, it can easily detect planets that are
                        relatively far away from the pulsar.</p>
